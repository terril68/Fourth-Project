                <h1 class="title">Why are young people leaving Pittsburgh? </h1>
                <p>A story by Teresa Liu</p>
                <p>
                    I was shocked to find that Pittsburgh, PA, was listed by <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/population-estimates-counties-decrease.html">a recent Census Bureau’s press release</a> as having the highest level of natural decrease among the 384 metro areas in the 50 states. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Natural decrease occurs when there are more deaths than births in a population over a period of time, according to the Census Bureau’s definition. It could be caused by fewer births, an aging population, and increased mortality. It also means that there are fewer families with young children in the city, which led to the natural decrease. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I grew up in Pittsburgh and left the city shortly after graduation to pursue a career in the news industry. At the time, I didn’t think the city offered a viable market for my field. Over the years, many of my friends had also relocated for various reasons. I wonder if young people in Pittsburgh are making the same decision like I did because they couldn’t find a suitable job in the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To test my theory, I first set out to find the most popular jobs for new college graduates. I scraped and analyzed employment projections for 2020-2030 from <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/occupational-projections-and-characteristics.htm">the Bureau of Labor Statistics </a>. I narrowed my data to those jobs that require a bachelor degree, that don’t need prior experience, and pay over $50,000.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The job that’s projected to grow the fastest under these conditions is film & video editor. It’s followed by data scientist, logistician, operational research analyst, actuary, market research analyst & marketing specialist, financial examiner, fine artist, fundraiser and special effects artist and animator, according to my analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several of these jobs require a business/marketing background, others fall in the computer science or logistics category. Quite a number of these careers fall in the arts category.

                    <h3>Fastest growing occupations with median income >= $50,000 (2020-2030)</h3>
                    <p class="subtitle">Actuaries, with a median annual income of $105,900, are the highest earners of the group. Fundraisers, who make $60,660 every year, ranked lowest in terms of salary. </p>

                <p>
                    I also want to find out the jobs available in Pittsburgh. To do so, I look at the biggest employers in the area. At first, I found this data from <a href="https://www.workstats.dli.pa.gov/Products/Top50/Pages/default.aspx">Pennsylvania’s Center for Workforce Information & Analysis </a>. Unfortunately, it didn’t show me the employee number for each of the companies listed. So I had to look for other sources. Eventually, I stumbled upon information collected by Pittsburgh Business Times. So I visualized it in the following chart by organizing the bubbles based on the number of local hires each company has.

                <p>
                    Many of Pittsburgh’s biggest companies are in the healthcare industry. Other big employers are governments or educational institutions. That could partly explain why many young people are moving away from Pittsburgh after college, because many of the jobs they find appealing are not found in Pittsburgh.
